Category	Checklist	Weight	Score (1-5)	Test Evidence
Modularity	Is the code organized into small, focused functions or classes?		5	Uses OOP principles, clear separation of concerns with distinct methods
	Does each function or class have a single responsibility?		5	DataProcessor defines ETL structure, CreditCardAnalysis implements clear separation
	Are related functionalities grouped logically into modules or packages?		4	Could benefit from further modularization (e.g., separate transformation logic)
	Is the component/module self-contained?		5	Can function independently; no strong external dependencies
	Can it function independently of the system?		5	Methods are encapsulated within the class, pipeline execution controlled via run_pipeline()
				
Loose Coupling	Does it minimize dependencies on other components?		4	Database and S3 interactions use standard interfaces but could benefit from abstraction
	Are external interfaces used instead of direct object references?		4	create_engine and boto3.client() use abstraction but could be wrapped further
				
High Cohesion	Are the functionalities within the component closely related?		5	ETL methods are logically grouped within CreditCardAnalysis
	Is it easy to understand and manage as a single unit?		5	Well-structured, clear docstrings and logging for visibility
				
Parameterization/ Configurations	Are values hardcoded, or can they be passed as parameters?	4	4	db_config and s3_config passed dynamically, but AWS keys should be sourced from env variables
	Are default values provided for optional parameters?		3	Credentials are required; no defaults for optional settings like batch size
	Is the use of global variables avoided?		5	No global variables used
				
Generalization	Is the code written to work with a broad set of inputs or use cases?		4	Uses dynamic SQL query and flexible data transformations
	Are data types and structures flexible (e.g., accepting iterable instead of a specific list)?		3	Could support different formats (e.g., JSON input/output)
	Are functions written to be data-agnostic when appropriate?		4	Transformation logic designed for adaptability
				
Separation of Concerns	Is business logic separated from I/O operations (e.g., reading files, printing)?		5	Extraction, transformation, and loading are separate methods
	Is configuration separated from core logic?		4	Config stored separately but could use environment variables
				
Versioning and Compatibility	Is there version control for the reusable asset?		3	No explicit versioning; should use Git or module versioning
	Are backward compatibility concerns addressed?		4	Uses standard Python libraries, ensuring compatibility
				
Documentation and Naming	Are function and variable names descriptive and meaningful?	5	5	Good naming conventions (extract_data(), transform_data())
	Are docstrings provided to explain purpose, parameters, and return values?		5	Comprehensive docstrings provided
	Are usage examples or comments included where needed?		4	Inline comments exist, but usage examples could be improved
				
Standard Interfaces	Are standard APIs or data formats used (e.g., REST, JSON, XML)?		3	S3 integration used, but additional API support (e.g., REST endpoint) would help
	Does it follow language or framework-specific best practices?		5	Uses Pandas, SQLAlchemy, boto3 according to best practices
				
Error Handling	Are errors and exceptions handled gracefully and not just passed or ignored?		4	Exceptions logged, but could add recovery mechanisms
	Are informative messages or exceptions provided to aid debugging?		5	Logs failures with useful messages
				
Dependencies	Is the code loosely coupled (minimal dependencies on external code)?		4	Only essential libraries used; abstraction could improve portability
	Are third-party libraries abstracted when necessary to make switching easier?		4	SQLAlchemy and boto3 used but could be wrapped further
				
Testability	Are there unit tests or examples for individual functions?		3	No explicit unit tests; should add pytest or unittest support
	Is the code structure compatible with automated testing frameworks (like unittest or pytest)?		3	Can be tested with mocks, but dedicated unit tests missing





Adherence to Standards	Is PEP8 or a consistent style guide followed?		5	Follows PEP8, clear structure and naming conventions
	Are type hints used where appropriate to clarify function signatures?		3	No type hints currently used, could be added
				
Reusability in Other Contexts	Can the code be used in scripts, web apps, or other systems without modification?		4	Modular but could benefit from a REST API wrapper
	Is there a clear entry point (e.g., function or class) for reuse?		5	run_pipeline() serves as the entry point
