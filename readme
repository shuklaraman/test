Overview of the ETL Pipeline
This code implements a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing and analyzing sales data. It is designed with a focus on modularity, reusability, and maintainability, ensuring efficient data processing and easy extension for future use cases.

Key Features of the ETL Pipeline
Separation of Core Processes

The pipeline is built using an abstract base class (ETLProcessor) to define the core ETL methods (extract, transform, load).

The concrete class (SalesDataPipeline) implements the actual data processing logic, providing a clear, structured approach to data management.

Modular and Reusable Design

The code is organized into small, focused methods, each responsible for a single task (e.g., data extraction, data transformation, data loading).

It follows object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, making it easier to extend and adapt for different data sources or analysis requirements.

Flexible and Configurable

The pipeline is parameterized, allowing it to work with different databases and storage systems without code modification.

It reads sensitive configurations like database credentials and AWS keys from environment variables, enhancing security and portability.

Error Handling and Logging

Detailed logging is implemented to track each stage of the pipeline, providing real-time feedback on execution status.

Graceful error handling ensures the pipeline can recover from common issues without crashing.

Data Quality and Integrity

Includes data cleaning, aggregation, and validation steps to ensure the quality and consistency of the processed data.

Designed to handle large datasets efficiently using Pandas for in-memory processing.

Scalable and Extensible

Built to handle multiple data formats and structures, making it adaptable to various business use cases.

Can be extended with additional methods or subclasses to support new data sources or processing logic.

Industry-Standard Practices

Follows PEP8 coding standards for readability and maintainability.

Uses type hints and comprehensive docstrings to improve code clarity and reduce onboarding time for new developers.

Example Workflow
Extract: Fetches raw sales data from a database using SQLAlchemy.

Transform: Cleans the data, performs aggregations, and calculates key metrics like sales totals and average revenue.

Load: Uploads the processed data to an S3 bucket for storage or further analysis.

Potential Extensions
Adding support for different data sources like APIs or file-based inputs.

Integrating automated testing and data validation to improve reliability.

Implementing more advanced data transformation techniques, like feature engineering or machine learning.
